# Intro-to-CS-2-Maze
This is the source of an assignment from my past 200 level intro to Computer Science course taught by Scott Robertson at UH Manoa.

The assignment involved generating a maze from a text file representation and navigating the maze to the exit using iterative methods (later also done using recursive methods). The assignment used two classes provided by the TA, the Cell and Grid classes.

In addition I expanded the Maze class to be able to randomly generate an n by m maze from a set of symbols in a text file.
